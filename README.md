# BRobot for Dynamo

A [BRobot](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/BRobot)-based [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.org/) package for robot control. 

## Setup
If you are not interested in the source code, just do the following:
- Open Dynamo or Dynamo Studio. 
- Create a new workspace.
- At the bottom of the left Library tab, there is an 'Add' dropdown. Choose 'Import library', and point to the 'BRobot-for-Dynamo.dll' file in the repo's 'Sample files' folder. 
- If everything went well, you should see a new 'BRobot-for-Dynamo' package on your Library. Here you will find all the BRobot nodes.

If you are not interested in the source code, just do the following:
- Close Dynamo.
- Clone this repository somewhere in your computer. 
- Go to the `package` folder.
- Copy the `BRobot for Dynamo` folder to your Dynamo's package folder. This will probably look something like `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\1.1\packages\`.
- To verify you installed this successfully, open Dynamo and go to `Packages > Manage Packages...`. The `BRobot for Dynamo` package should show up on that list. 

## Tutorials
There are a bunch of Dynamo files in the `extra` folder that comes with this package. You can find them if you go to `Packages > Manage Packages...`, then click on the options on the right of `BRobot for Dynamo` and choose `Show Root Directory`. These files will help you understand how to setup a BRobot project. I will write a dedicated walkthrough section sometime soon.
