# Machina for Dynamo

![](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/Machina-Dynamo/blob/master/assets/banner.png)

A [Machina](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/Machina)-based [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.org/) package for robot control.

## Setup
If you are not interested in the source code, just do the following:
- Make sure you have the latest version of Dynamo Studio. Open it.
- Go to `Packages > Search for a Package...` and type `Machina` on the searchbox. You should be able to install the latest version.

## Tutorials
There are a bunch of Dynamo files in the `extra` folder that comes with this package. You can find them if you go to `Packages > Manage Packages...`, then click on the options on the right of `Machina` and choose `Show Root Directory`. These files will help you understand how to setup a Machina project. I will write a dedicated walkthrough section sometime soon.
